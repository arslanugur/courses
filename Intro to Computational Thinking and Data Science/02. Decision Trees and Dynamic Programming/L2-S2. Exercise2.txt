# 1.1. Dynamic programming can be used to solve optimization problems where the size of the space of possible solutions is exponentially large.
# ---> TRUE
  
# 1.2. Dynamic programming can be used to find an approximate solution to an optimization problem, but cannot be used to find a solution that is guaranteed to be optimal.
# ---> FALSE
  
# 1.3. Recall that sorting a list of integers can take O(nlogn) using an algorithm like merge sort. 
# Dynamic programming can be used to reduce the order of algorithmic complexity of sorting a list of integers to something below nlogn, 
# where n is the length of the list to be sorted.
# ---> FALSE
  
   
# 1.4. Problem: I need to go up a flight of N stairs. I can either go up 1 or 2 steps every time. 
#               How many different ways are there for me to traverse these steps? For example:

# 3 steps -> could be 1,1,1 or 1,2 or 2,1
# 4 steps -> could be 1,1,1,1 or 1,1,2 or 1,2,1 or 2,1,1 or 2,2
# 5 steps -> could be 1,1,1,1,1 or 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,2,1 or 1,2,1,1 or 2,1,1,1 or 2,2,1 or 1,2,2 or 2,1,2
  
# Does this problem have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems?
# ---> It has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems


# Explanation to #4:
# Optimal substructure: "Optimal solution" in this case is the number of possible ways of traversing k steps -- 
# it’s a somewhat trivial sense of “optimal”, with one good (correct) answer and infinite bad (incorrect) answers. 
# But we can indeed figure out the solution for k+1 or k+2 steps using the solution to k.
# Overlapping subproblems: Say there are 8 steps. 
# The solution for 5 steps is required at least three times, as you can do [1,1,1] or [1,2] or [2,1] to reduce the solution to 5 steps.
